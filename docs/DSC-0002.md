# DSC-0002: Deleting Pydantic
# Date: 24-10-2024
# Decision: Deleting the pydantic modules from the project
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: Issues with working smoothly
# Reason: Due to the already difficult assignment, we decided to delete the pydantic modules to not make the coding look slightly nicer with pydantic, but more focusing on the functionality of the code without pydantic
# Limitations: Less easy readable code
# Alternatives: Using pydantic
