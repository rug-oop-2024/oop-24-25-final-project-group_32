# DSC-0010: Management folder
# Date: 10-11-2024
# Decision: Extra folder for GUI management
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: Better following of OOP principles
# Reason: To make the code more readable and easier to manage, we decided to create an extra folder in which
# we would store the management of the different webpages instead of creating 3 unnecessary long page files
# Alternatives: Keep the management within the page files.
