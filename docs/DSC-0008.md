# DSC-0008: Windows doesn't support GUI
# Date: 5-11-2024
# Decision: GUI will only be made on Luca's Mac laptop.
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: Windows crashes GUI
# Reason: After sitting with a TA (TEUN) for 45 minutes to figure out why the GUI runs on Mac and not windows, we decided to make the GUI compatible only for Mac.
# Limitations: GUI not compatible for every system
# Alternatives: Making it compatibe, don't have the skill to do.
